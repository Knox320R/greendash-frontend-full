GreenDash - Functional Scope (Final Version for Developer Implementation)
1. User Roles
Each user can act as an Investor, a Networker, or both.
The system automatically identifies user roles based on their actions.
2. Investors
Investors purchase staking packages and receive a fixed amount of EGD, based on the exchange
rate of $0.01 = 1 EGD.
- EGD received is immediately locked (staked) for 365 days
- Users earn daily rewards in EGD
- They can swap EGD to USDT (manual) and request withdrawals
Staking Packages:
Package Name | Price (USDT) | EGD Received | Daily Yield (%)
Daily Ride | $100 | 10,000 EGD | 0.10%
Weekly Pass | $500 | 50,000 EGD | 0.20%
