GreenDash
Sustainable Mobility
Slide 1
How much would you have earned in 2024 if you had received $0.01 for every Uber ride
completed that year?
slide 2
🚀 Total earnings:
● Daily: $300,000
● Monthly: $9,000,000
● Annually: $109,500,000
This is the size of the market!
Slide 3 - What is the GreenDash?
eGreenDash is a platform that revolutionizes urban mobility.
Our system is decentralized, where drivers earn more, passengers pay less, and we
guarantee a positive environmental impact.
slide 4 - Project Pillars
● Drivers earn more: Drivers keep 90% of the earnings from each ride.
● Passengers pay less: With a more efficient system, ride costs are up to 20% cheaper
for passengers.
● Sustainability: Exclusive use of electric cars, reducing carbon emissions in urban
transportation.
slide 5 Direct Comparison with Uber
Criteria eGreenDash Uber
Driver Fee 10% 20% to 30% (up to 3x more)
Profit Sharing Yes, for token holders No
Sustainability Use of electric cars No clear focus
Governance Decentralized Centralized
Passenger Cost Up to 20% cheaper High fares
Slide 6
The eGreenDash model is more attractive than Uber, offering lower fees
for drivers and affordable fares for passengers. Unlike other mobility
platforms, everyone can become a stakeholder and profit from its
growth.
Slide 7
The Growth Opportunity with eGreenDash
● 🚗 Uber MarketCap reach $170 billion in 2025.
● 📊 35 million rides per day, 12 billion rides per year.
● 💡 When eGreenDash captures only 1% of this market, it will already be a
billion-dollar business.
Slide 8 Growth Comparison - Uber vs eGreenDash
If a person had invested $100 in Uber in 2009, when tokens were worth $0.01, they would
have acquired 10,000 tokens.
Today, with the Uber Market Cap values reaching $170 billion, that investment would have
turned into $1,700,000.
This represents a 1,700,000% increase, showing how entering at the right moment can
be extremely profitable.
💡 eGreenDash follows a similar model but with competitive advantages, such as
sustainable mobility and profit-sharing.
⚠️ Disclaimer: This calculation is a simulation based on Uber’s history. Past results do not
guarantee future returns. Token success depends on the market, regulations, and project
growth.
