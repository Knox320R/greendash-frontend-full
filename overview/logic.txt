GreenDash Token Utility & Staking Logic
1. Token Purchase & Lock
Users buy EGD tokens and select one of the fixed staking packages. Each package locks the user's tokens
for exactly 365 days. During this period, they receive a daily farming reward based on the package selected.
2. Staking Packages (Mobility Model)
Package Stake Amount (EGD) Daily Yield (%)
Daily Ride 100 0.10%
Weekly Pass 500 0.20%
Economy Car 1,000 0.30%
Business Fleet 5,000 0.40%
Personal EV 10,000 0.50%
Luxury Fleet 50,000 0.60%
Corporate Mobility Hub 100,000 0.70%
3. Reward Options
Users receive daily farming rewards in EGD tokens. They can:
1. Accumulate the EGD tokens.
2. Swap them manually to USDT (BEP-20) anytime through the platform.
Note: Conversion is not automatic.
4. Revenue Distribution Mechanism
Every transaction on the platform includes a 10% fee. This fee is collected into a revenue pool and distributed
daily to all token holders based on their proportion of total staked tokens.
