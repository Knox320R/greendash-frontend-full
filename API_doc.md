## üéØ Business Rules & Logic

### 300% Benefit Cap System
- **Calculation**: `totalBenefit = new_egd_balance + (withdrawal_history_excluding_achieved + new_withdrawals) / seed_token_price`
- **Enforcement**: When 300% is reached, all active staking packages are automatically completed
- **User Status**: `benefit_overflow` flag is set to prevent further rewards
- **Package Lifecycle**: Completed packages cannot earn additional rewards

### One Active Package Rule
- **Enforcement**: Users can only have 1 active staking package at a time
- **Upgrade Logic**: Current package must be completed before starting new one
- **Size Requirement**: New package must be bigger than current package for upgrades
- **Automatic Completion**: Old package is automatically completed during upgrade
- **API Response**: `recent_staking` returns only the most recent staking record (single object, not array)

### Balance Management System
- **Field Structure**: 
  - `new_egd_balance` + `old_egd_balance` = total EGD balance
  - `new_withdrawals` + `old_withdrawals` = total withdrawal balance
- **Transfer Logic**: When starting new staking, current balances are transferred to old fields
- **Virtual Getters**: `egd_balance` and `withdrawals` automatically calculate sums

### Withdrawal Achievement System
- **Status Tracking**: Withdrawals progress through: pending ‚Üí approved ‚Üí completed ‚Üí achieved
- **Achievement Logic**: All completed withdrawals are marked as "achieved" when starting new staking
- **Cap Calculation**: Only non-achieved withdrawals count toward 300% benefit cap

### Reward Distribution Rules
- **Active Stakers Only**: Only users with active staking packages receive rewards
- **Benefit Overflow Check**: Users with `benefit_overflow = true` are excluded from all rewards
- **Commission System**: Unilevel commissions up to 9 levels, paid in EGD
- **Daily Rewards**: Based on staking package daily yield percentage

---

## üöÄ System Features

### Automatic Processes
- **Daily Bonus Distribution**: Automatic daily reward distribution to active stakers
